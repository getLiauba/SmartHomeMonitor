<h2> Week Five </h2>

<p>This week we set up our Broadcom development platform's(BDP) SD card and using VNC viewer to interact with the BDP. In this case I will be using the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ edition </p>

<h2> Week Four </h2>

<p>This week my group and I purchased our assigned materials and equipment and was required to show proof of purchase. The only euipment I needed to purchase was the HC-SR501 Pyroelectric Infrared Sensor This sensor is used to detect moving objects </p>

<h2> Week Three </h2>

<p> This week my team and I discussed the parts and materials we need in order to complete our project. After this discussion I then created a Project </p>

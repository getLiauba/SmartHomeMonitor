# Smart Home Monitor (HC-SR501 PIR)

<h2> Week Eight </h2>

<p> This week the Breadboard milestone was due. Using the raspberry Pi and HC-SR501 sensor, I managed to write a C program using the wiring Pi Libaray to detect motion and turn on an LED when motion was detected. Overall the milestone was sucessfully met on time, Financially I am on track <p>

 <p> Below is a link to the C program used to activate an LED when motion is detected by the HC-SR501 sensor<p>

<h2> Week Seven </h2>

<p> This week I designed my PCB board in fritzing. I also created a schematic and breadboard mockup (uploaded october 14th)</p>

<h2> Week Five </h2>

<p>This week we set up our Broadcom development platform's(BDP) SD card and using VNC viewer to interact with the BDP. In this case I will be using the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ edition </p>

<h2> Week Four </h2>

<p>This week my group and I purchased our assigned materials and equipment and was required to show proof of purchase. The only euipment I needed to purchase was the HC-SR501 Pyroelectric Infrared Sensor This sensor is used to detect moving objects </p>

<h2> Week Three </h2>

<p> This week my team and I discussed the parts and materials we need in order to complete our project. After this discussion I then created a Project </p>

<h2> Week Two </h2>

<p>This second week I created a Gantt Chart to outline all the tasks to be completed week by week </p>

<h2> Week One </h2>

<p>This week we selected a project and settled on a smart home idea, and created a proposal.</p>

<p>These build instructions will help you use the HC-SR501 sensor along with the raspberry pi in order to be able to detect motion. The sensor has 3 pins: VCC, GND, OUT. The operational voltage for the sensor is between 5 and 20 volts with an output voltage of 3.3V when motion is detected and 0V when no motion is detected. For more details about this sensor you can check out the link below </p>

## <a name="Materials/Budget">Materials/Budget</a>

<p>This project will require alot of materials and is reccomended to be purchased at once so that you can have all your materials together and ready to complete the project in a weekend.
  
RaspberryPi (These instructions will be using the B+ modle although new versions should work as well) <br>
HC-SR501 $10 (Reccomended to get a multi-pack the first one I used was broken)<br>
Solder<br>
Breadboard <br>
LED<br>
330 Ohm resistor <br>
Jumpper cables <br>
Safty goggles <br>
Soldering Iron <br>
USB to Ethernet adapter (This may not be needed if your computer/ Laptop as a Ethernet port) <br> 
Ethernet cable <br>
3 Pin header  <br>
6 Pin header  <br>

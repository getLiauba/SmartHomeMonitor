<p>These build instructions will help you use the HC-SR501 sensor along with the raspberry pi in order to be able to detect motion. The sensor has 3 pins: VCC, GND, OUT. The operational voltage for the sensor is between 5 and 20 volts with an output voltage of 3.3V when motion is detected and 0V when no motion is detected.
